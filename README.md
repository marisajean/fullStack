# fullStack
This repo contains examples of my coding abilities across a full range tech stack. While the majority of work I have done has been proprietary and thus not able to be shared, the files in this repo show snippets of my capabilities. They also come from different origin sources and are not meant to be seen as related files. See bow for outlines of what each file showcases. 

# NLPExample.py

This file contains snippets of code drafted for my research conducted at the University of Virginia for the Computer Science department. It specifically works with webscraped HTML files and pulls out necessary data for analysis, including article titles, publishing dates, and article bodies. Additional functions begin to apply Named Entity Recognition on the parsed data. This project had additional code that modified databases, did targeted sentiment analysis, and more. 

# APIExample.py 

I have several years of experience building API routes for web applications for both TD Securities and Seam Social Labs, but much of the code is not able to be shared. This file contains a simple example of an API route that communicates with a MariaDB database to save and update user data. It is not functional as a stand alone file, but rather meant to be a glimpse into a larger code repo. 

# Front End Work 

Current examples of my front end coding capabilites are proprietary, but my personal website is under construction! See screenshots below for a brief video clicking through a variety of webpages I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for co:census.
